# Content of the repository
The notebooks contained in this repository were created as a project for the Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning course.
The project was divided into three parts, that were Classification, Segmentation and Visual Question Answering.

# Classification
The notebook contained in the classification directory was trained on a set of images containing people that were either wearing masks or not, and the model had to recognise if all of the people were "masked", if no one had a mask on or if there were people of both sets into the picture.

## Example
Given the image below as input

![Image Classification](/pictures/classification_image.png)

the network outputs (with accuracy over 0.90) that all the people in the picture have the mask on
