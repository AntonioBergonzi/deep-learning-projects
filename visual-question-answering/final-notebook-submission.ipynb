However, we didn't reach the performance that we wanted and so we decided to change our model. \n","\n","We substituted the rnn part with bert, reaching better performances. We noticed that the dataset was really imbalanced since there were a lot of samples with \"yes\" or \"no\" as outputs (more or less half of the dataset), so we changed totally our approach to the problem. As shown in this notebook, we trained a meta-learner that classifies the answer type into two classes based on the input question (class 1 if the answer is expected to be \"yes\" or \"no\", class 0 otherwise). The benefit of this approach is to automatically balance the dataset. We then trained two different models (see the other two notebooks) based on the previous split. \n","\n","In particular, in these models we kept the architecture of bert+vgg, but we changed the way they interact, having as reference the following paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01455](http://) (at page 2 you can find the plot of the model's structure). At the end of the other two notebooks we saved the weights of the models in order to load them in this one (we had a problem with bert and we couldn't use the \"model.save\" function but we had to use this approach) and make the predictions on the test based on the outcome of the meta-learner. With this approach we reached the 0.54 in accuracy. We then tried glove instead of bert, but the performance didn't improve and so we didn't change.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-01-16T08:52:21.702523Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-01-16T08:52:21.70196Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-01-16T08:52:25.788373Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-01-16T08:52:25.78696Z"},"papermill":{"duration":4.125007,"end_time":"2021-01-16T08:52:25.788484","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-01-16T08:52:21.663477","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import
